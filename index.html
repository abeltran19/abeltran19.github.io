        <p2>
            MediPod is designed to help healthcare workers keep up-to-date with the latest technologies, discoveries, issues, and news in the medical world. MediPod allows their users to either host their podcasts as they talk about any relevant topic in the medical world, while also allowing others to listen and share their opinions regarding the same topics.

            MediPod has been so useful for me! I listen to it while driving to work everyday, so I always know what the latest technologies and discoveries are in the medical field. I can even choose which categories I want to listen to depending on the day. The search function is very convenient! And if I like a certain podcast maker, I can just follow them so I can be notified if they upload new episodes of their podcasts!
